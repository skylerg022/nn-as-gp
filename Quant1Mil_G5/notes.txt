
NOTE: UPDATE THESE NON-GAUSSIAN EVALUATION WITH GAUSSIAN NUMBERS AFTER MODELS RUN

Gridsearch Notes
* Note: The best performing test RMSE's for this Gaussian dataset are about 0.0095 according to Figure S4 in
  the supplementary material for the paper "Competition on Spatial Statistics for Large Datasets" by Huang et al.
