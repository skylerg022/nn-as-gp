## Introduction to Project Repository

This repository contains the code used for the research in my Master's project (see the project report [here](https://github.com/skylerg022/nn-as-gp/blob/main/masters_writeup_4_15.pdf)).

### Data

The land surface temperature data (Quant150K and Quant150K) should be available in this report by the end of April 2022.

The quantitative 1-million and 90K datasets come from the "Competition on Spatial Statistics for Large Datasets" by Huang et al. (2021) and are available at [https://doi.org/10.25781/KAUST-8VP2V](https://doi.org/10.25781/KAUST-8VP2V). After downloading the files, create a `data` directory in the respective project folders (for example, the directory `Quant1Mil_G5/data`) and move the data files to their respective `data` directories.
